# GitHub Copilot Instructions for P8 Command Usage

## Project Context
This Laravel project uses a custom `p8.bat` wrapper script instead of the standard `php artisan` command. GitHub Copilot should be aware of this convention when suggesting commands or code.

## Command Translation
When suggesting Laravel Artisan commands, always use `p8` instead of `php artisan`:

### ❌ Don't suggest:
```cmd
php artisan migrate
php artisan make:controller UserController
php artisan serve
php artisan cache:clear
```

### ✅ Always suggest:
```cmd
p8 migrate
p8 make:controller UserController
p8 serve
p8 cache:clear
```

## Integration Guidelines for Copilot

1. **Command Suggestions**: Always suggest `p8` commands instead of `php artisan`
2. **Documentation**: When generating README files or documentation, use `p8` in examples
3. **Setup Instructions**: Include `p8` commands in installation and setup guides
4. **Code Comments**: Reference `p8` commands in code comments when relevant
5. **Terminal Snippets**: Use `p8` in any terminal command suggestions

## Example Responses

### When asked about running migrations:
```cmd
p8 migrate
```
